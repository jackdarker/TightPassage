# TightPassage
2d top down dungeon crawler made with python/pygame

Features:
- ~~Uses OGMO to create levels~~ There is still the OgmoImporter.py but its not used anymore.

- Uses __Tiled__ to create levels and load them with __pytmx__ and __pyscroll__.
- connect maps with doors/teleporters
- loading sprite-animation from spritesheets (facing in 4 directions, idle,walk, attack, die)

Todo:
- HUD-overlay
- overworld
- minimap
- AI for enemies
- minigames like a struggle-bar ?
- possibility to show intro/extro and dialogs
- a screen to manage equipment/stats
- inventory-system
- quest-system and NPCs
- loot and enemies!

I tried to reuse some components from different python-games/-engines:
- RagnarokEngine3
